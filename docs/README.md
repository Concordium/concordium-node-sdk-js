# docs

Holds documentation to be built into the documentation generated by typedoc.
Currently, this needs to use its own version of typescript due to incompatibility
with the version used in the rest of the workspace.

## Project structure

Pages reside in the `./pages` folder, and should be included by adding
a corresponding entry in `typedoc.json`.
