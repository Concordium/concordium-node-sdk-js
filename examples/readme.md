## Examples for the Concordium NodeJS-SDK

This is a collection of scripts/examples that utilizes the SDK. There are
two directories with examples `client`, containing examples that utilize the
client, and `common`, that use various general functions from the library. To
run an example call:

```shell
yarn ts-node /path/to/example.ts [opts]
```

Where opts are any arguments that the example script takes.
